Here are the 3 core functionalities that would deliver maximum impact with minimal complexity:

1. Smart CV-Job Match Analyzer
Upload CV + paste job description → get instant compatibility score and specific gap analysis

- What it does: Identifies missing keywords, skills, and experiences
- Output: Percentage match score + bullet-point list of what to add/emphasize
- Why essential: This is the unique value - nobody else does job-specific CV analysis this simply

2. AI Interview Question Generator
Based on the CV-job analysis, auto-generate likely interview questions with suggested answers

- What it does: Creates 8-12 tailored questions focusing on CV gaps and job requirements
- Output: Questions + framework for answers + tips on what employers want to hear
- Why essential: Bridges the gap from CV optimization to actual interview success

3. One-Click CV Optimizer
Takes the existing CV and auto-suggests specific rewrites for better job matching

- What it does: Recommends exact phrase replacements, section reordering, and content additions
- Output: Side-by-side before/after CV with highlighted changes
- Why essential: Turns insights into actionable CV improvements without starting from scratch

Why These 3 Work Together
- Each functionality feeds into the next:

- Analyze → identify gaps
- Prepare → get ready for interviews about those gaps
- Optimize → fix the CV to better match

This creates a complete workflow while keeping each feature simple and automatable. Users get end-to-end value without you needing to build complex features like full CV builders or extensive coaching modules.

The beauty is that all three can be heavily automated with AI, require minimal ongoing support, and solve the complete problem in one session.
