Based on market research and user behavior patterns, here's the realistic monetization landscape:

# What Users WILL Pay For (High Conversion)
1. Pay Per Analysis Model ($4.99-$7.99 per scan)

- Highest conversion rate - users pay only when they need it
- No commitment anxiety
- Targets active job seekers who need immediate results
- Jobscan charges $49.95/month but users often find this steep OfftheclockresumesSaasworthy

2. Job Search Bundles ($19.99 for 10 analyses)
- Perfect for active job hunters applying to multiple positions
- Creates urgency and bulk value perception
- Higher average order value than single purchases

# Subscription Reality Check
## Subscription challenges for this niche:
- Users find monthly subscriptions "steep" even at established players Is Jobscan.co Worth It? Read This Before You Pay
- Job search is temporary (2-6 months average)
- High churn after landing a job
- Users prefer one-time payments for temporary needs

## Limited subscription viability:
- Maybe 15-20% conversion to subscription
- Most would prefer pay-per-use
- Even market leader Jobscan offers only 2 free scans to push paid conversion Jobscan Review: Is Jobscan Worth It (Free and Paid)? - NextAdvocate.com

# Realistic Pricing Strategy
## Winning approach:
- Freemium: 1 free analysis to demonstrate value
- Pay-per-use: $5.99 per comprehensive analysis
- Job search package: $24.99 for 6 months unlimited access
- Premium features: $9.99/month for interview prep + CV optimization (for active searchers only)

## Why this works:
- Lower barrier to entry than Jobscan's $49.95-89.95 pricing OfftheclockresumesMyPerfectResume
- Captures both casual and intensive users
- Reduces subscription fatigue
- Higher volume potential at lower price points

The key is positioning as a "job search tool" not a "career development subscription" - users want to solve an immediate problem, not ongoing career management.
