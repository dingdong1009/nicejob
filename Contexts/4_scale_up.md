## Smart Implementation Order

**Prioritize based on:**
1. **Revenue impact** - LinkedIn optimizer and cover letter generator first
2. **Technical reuse** - Features using existing AI infrastructure
3. **User requests** - Track what users ask for most
4. **Market differentiation** - Interview simulator sets you apart

**Avoid building:**
- Complex scheduling systems
- Video interview practice (too resource-intensive)
- Full career coaching features (scope creep)
- Social networking features (not core to job search)

The key is each feature should either directly generate revenue, increase user retention, or create competitive advantage - while reusing as much existing infrastructure as possible.
