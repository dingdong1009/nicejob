You're tackling a real pain point - the gap between generic CV advice and job-specific preparation. Let me break this down strategically:

# Core Problem We're Solving
The mismatch between candidate presentation and employer expectations. Most job seekers submit generic CVs without understanding how well they align with specific job requirements. They lack targeted feedback on what employers actually want to see.

# Streamlined Service Offering
## Keep it to 2-3 core services:

- CV-Job Match Analysis: Upload CV + paste job description â†’ get automated scoring and specific improvement suggestions
- CV Builder with Job Targeting: Either upload existing CV or build from scratch, with real-time optimization suggestions
- Interview Prep Generator: Auto-generate likely interview questions based on the job description and CV gaps

# Business Model & Monetization
## Freemium with Usage Limits:
- Free: 1 CV analysis per month
- Premium ($9.99/month or $19.99 for 3 months): Unlimited analyses, advanced feedback, interview prep, CV builder templates
- One-time packages: $4.99 per analysis for occasional users

## Why this works despite low return rates:
- High volume, low-touch model
- Target active job seekers (millions searching monthly)
- Short conversion window but immediate need
- Viral potential (people share when job hunting)

# Automation Strategy
## Core automations to implement:
- AI-powered CV parsing and analysis (using OpenAI API or similar)
- Keyword matching algorithms between CV and job descriptions
- Automated email sequences for onboarding and retention
- Social media content automation (LinkedIn posts about job search tips)
- SEO-optimized blog auto-generation about industry-specific CV advice

# Platform integrations:
- LinkedIn API for profile import
- Indeed/LinkedIn job scraping for job description templates
- Stripe for payments
- Mailchimp/ConvertKit for email automation

# Market Interest & Validation
## Strong indicators of demand:
- "Resume review" gets 40K+ monthly searches
- Existing services like Jobscan charge $49.95/month
- Career coaching is a $20B+ industry
- High unemployment periods create surge demand

# Technical Implementation (Keep It Simple)
## MVP Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React/Next.js with simple templates
- Backend: Node.js with OpenAI API integration
- Database: Supabase
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify + Supabase
- Payments: Stripe

## Launch Strategy:
- Build MVP with CV analysis only
- Launch on ProductHunt and Reddit job communities
- Create free value through LinkedIn content
- Add premium features based on user feedback
- Scale with SEO content and partnerships

The key is starting simple, automating everything possible, and capturing value during the intense but brief job search periods. The low return rate is offset by the large market size and willingness to pay for immediate results.
